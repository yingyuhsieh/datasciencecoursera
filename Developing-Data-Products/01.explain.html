Server-client architecture is widely used in software development, such as <b>web server & client browsers</b>, <b>FTP server & FTP client</b>…<br><br>
Usually, the server will limit the number of <b>active thread</b> to serve requests from client. Depending on the features of application and server capacity, the number of active thread may vary (for example, Apache Tomcat 7 (web application server) has default maximum threads = 200.<br><br>
Lately, I had the chance to run a black-box testing on a server-client application and would like to know the number of active thread. When I use server to send some <b>instruction</b> to all the clients, it will need time to complete the task on all clients. The time will depend on <b>active thread</b> number, machine capacity, traffic condition and so on…<br><br>
The dataset is the event logs from the application server which record the start time and end time of the client. I will use the data to find out the <b>active thread</b> number which will help me to predict service time for greater number clients.<br><br>
